\subsection{Design Requirements}

To streamline the design of our prototype and to ensure its usefulness to other researchers in future work, we established the following design requirements:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textsf{DRQ\arabic*}, left=1em .. 4.5em]
    \item \textbf{Intuitive}\label{drq:intuitive}\\
        Controlling the prototype device should be intuitive to the user.

    \item \textbf{Robust}\label{drq:robust} \\
        Using the prototype device should require minimal user intervention and maintenance. Users should not be able to easily break the device, and it should withstand external influences such as humidity and temperature variations.

    \item \textbf{Safe}\label{drq:safe}\\
        The prototype device should not compromise the user's safety.

    \item \textbf{Affordable}\label{drq:affordable}\\
        The total cost of all required components should not exceed \euro25.00.

    \item \textbf{Easy to Reproduce}\label{drq:easy_to_reproduce}\\
        The prototype device should be able to be manufactured and assembled using standard tools commonly available in most research laboratories.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
In \autoref{subsec:discussion_design_requirements} we analyze how well our final prototype device meets these requirements based on the results gathered from our field study.

\subsection{Mechanical Design}

\cite{gesturing_on_the_handlebars} \cite{no_need_to_stop} \cite{text_me_if_you_can} \cite{brotate_and_tribike}

\begin{itemize}
    \item potentiometers vs. rotary switches vs. buttons
    \item brotate and tribike \cite{brotate_and_tribike}
    \item advantages/disadvantages of using our own hardware design (cost, reliability, availability, obsolete components)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electrical Design and Firmware}

\begin{itemize}
    \item BLE
    \item MCU choice (softdevices conformity)
    \item battery runtime analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frontend Design}

\begin{itemize}
    \item reusability
    \item BLE interfacing (communication "protocol")
    \item language/framework choice?
    \item UI design?
\end{itemize}
