    \subsubsection*{Abstract}
    This work explores creating an improved method for recording real-time ground truth data on cyclists' subjective experiences (CSE).
    It presents the design process of a physical prototype, resembling a standard bicycle twist gearshift, which enables cyclists to provide ratings on a Likert scale without interrupting their cycling or compromising their safety.
    A field study was conducted to evaluate the prototype against other state-of-the-art methods.
    Results showed that participants strongly preferred using our prototype, highlighting its ease of use, intuitive handling, and lack of concerns regarding social acceptance or additional time requirements compared to other methods.
    Our evaluation of recorded travel satisfaction data showed little evidence for quantitative differences between the compared methods.
    This research paves the way for larger field studies by providing a better method to either directly record \CSE or the necessary ground truth data to infer them from additional contextual and sensory data.
