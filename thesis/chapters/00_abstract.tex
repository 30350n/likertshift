    This work explores creating an improved method for recording ground truth Travel Experience data while cycling.
    It shows the design process of a physical prototype, resembling a standard bicycle twist gearshift, which allows cyclists to provide ratings on a standard five-point Likert scale without interrupting their cycling or compromising their safety.
    A field study was conducted to evaluate using the prototype against other state-of-the-art methods.
    Results showed that participants strongly preferred using the prototype, highlighting its ease of use, intuitive handling, and lack of concerns regarding social acceptance or additional time requirements compared to the other methods.
    Additionally, an evaluation of the recorded ground truth Travel Experience data confirmed that the data collected using the prototype was of comparable or superior quality to that collected using the existing state-of-the-art methods.
    This research paves the way for larger field studies by providing a better method to either directly record cyclists' Travel Experience or the necessary ground truth data to infer it from additional sensory data.
